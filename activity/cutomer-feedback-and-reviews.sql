Algorithm:
  
Customer_Feedback_and_Reviews(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all customer feedback and reviews within the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each review, extract the following details:
     - Review ID
     - Customer ID
     - Date and time the review was submitted
     - Rating (e.g., stars, score)
     - Review text (optional)
     - Product or service being reviewed
  3. Calculate the average rating across all reviews:
     - Average Rating = Sum of ratings / Number of reviews.
  4. Optionally, categorize reviews by rating (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).
  5. Calculate the number of reviews by category (e.g., number of 5-star reviews, 1-star reviews).
  6. Identify any recurring feedback patterns (e.g., common complaints, feature requests).
  7. Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect review entries).
  8. Store the customer feedback data and return the results (summary of reviews, average rating, feedback patterns).
