Algorithm:
  
Budget_vs_Actuals_Report(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve the planned budget data for the specified date range (startDate to endDate):
     - Budget data includes planned amounts for each category (e.g., revenue, expenses) for the period.
  2. Retrieve the actual financial data for the same date range:
     - Actuals data includes the actual amounts spent or earned for each category during the period.
  3. Compare the budgeted amounts to the actual amounts for each category:
     - For each category, calculate the variance:
       - Variance = Actuals - Budgeted Amount.
  4. For each category, calculate the percentage variance:
     - Percentage Variance = (Variance / Budgeted Amount) * 100.
  5. Optionally, categorize the results by type (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit, etc.).
  6. Optionally, calculate the cumulative totals for both budgeted and actual amounts:
     - Total Budget = Sum of all budgeted amounts for the period.
     - Total Actuals = Sum of all actual amounts for the period.
     - Cumulative Variance = Total Actuals - Total Budget.
  7. Identify any categories where the variance is significant (e.g., over-budget or under-budget by a certain threshold).
  8. Validate the budget and actual data (ensure no missing or incorrect entries).
  9. Store the Budget vs. Actuals report and return the results:
     - Include a breakdown of each categoryâ€™s budgeted, actual, variance, and percentage variance.
     - Optionally, include a summary of total budget, total actuals, and overall variance.
