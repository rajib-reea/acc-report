Algorithm:
  
API_Usage_and_Performance_Report(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all API usage logs for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each API call, extract the following details:
     - API Endpoint
     - Date and time of the call
     - Response time (e.g., time taken to process the request)
     - Status of the request (e.g., successful, failed)
     - Request parameters (optional)
  3. Calculate the total number of API calls by status (e.g., successful, failed).
  4. Calculate the average response time for all API calls:
     - Average Response Time = Sum of response times / Total API calls.
  5. Optionally, identify any API performance issues (e.g., slow endpoints, frequent failures).
  6. Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect API call entries).
  7. Store the API usage data and return the results (summary of API usage, success rates, and performance metrics).
