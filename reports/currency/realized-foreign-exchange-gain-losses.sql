Algorithm:
  
Realized_Foreign_Exchange_Gains_Losses(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all foreign exchange (FX) transactions within the specified date range (startDate to endDate):
     - These transactions could include payments, receipts, or conversions involving foreign currencies.
  2. For each FX transaction, extract the following details:
     - Transaction date
     - Original currency amount
     - Original currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction
     - Settlement amount (in local or functional currency)
     - Settlement exchange rate (when the transaction was closed or settled)
  3. Calculate the realized FX gain or loss for each transaction:
     - Realized Gain/Loss = (Settlement Amount - Original Amount) * (Settlement Exchange Rate - Original Exchange Rate).
     - If the result is positive, it is a gain; if negative, it is a loss.
  4. Summarize the realized FX gains and losses for all transactions within the specified period:
     - Total Realized FX Gains = Sum of all positive realized gains.
     - Total Realized FX Losses = Sum of all negative realized losses.
  5. Validate the data (ensure all transactions have correct exchange rates, amounts, and settlement details).
  6. Store the Realized FX Gains/Losses report and return the results:
     - Include the realized gains and losses for each transaction, along with the total realized FX gains and losses for the period.
