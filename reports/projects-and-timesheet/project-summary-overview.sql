Algorithm:
  
Project_Summary_Overview(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all projects within the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. Retrieve project-related data (e.g., cost, revenue, hours worked).
  3. For each project, calculate the total cost, total revenue, and total hours worked.
  4. Optionally, calculate the total profit for each project:
     Profit = Project Revenue - Project Cost.
  5. Calculate the overall total project costs, total revenue, and total profits across all projects.
  6. Optionally, calculate the total time spent on each project.
  7. Validate the data (ensure no invalid or missing values).
  8. Store the project summary data and return the results (overview of all projects).

SQL:
-- Step 1: Retrieve all projects within the specified date range
WITH project_data AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        p.project_name,
        p.start_date,
        p.end_date
    FROM projects p
    WHERE p.start_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
),

-- Step 2: Retrieve project-related data (cost, revenue, hours worked)
project_cost_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        pr.project_id,
        prc.total_cost,
        pr.client_rate
    FROM projects_revenue pr
    JOIN projects_costs prc ON pr.project_id = prc.project_id
),

-- Step 3: Calculate total hours worked per project
project_hours AS (
    SELECT
        te.project_id,
        SUM(te.hours_worked) AS total_hours_worked
    FROM timesheet_entries te
    WHERE te.entry_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
    GROUP BY te.project_id
)

-- Step 4: Calculate total cost, revenue, and profit
SELECT
    pd.project_id,
    pd.project_name,
    COALESCE(prc.total_cost, 0) AS total_cost,
    COALESCE(prc.client_rate, 0) * COALESCE(th.total_hours_worked, 0) AS total_revenue,
    COALESCE(th.total_hours_worked, 0) AS total_hours_worked,
    -- Step 5: Calculate profitability (revenue - cost)
    (COALESCE(prc.client_rate, 0) * COALESCE(th.total_hours_worked, 0)) - COALESCE(prc.total_cost, 0) AS total_profit

FROM project_data pd
LEFT JOIN project_cost_revenue prc ON pd.project_id = prc.project_id
LEFT JOIN project_hours th ON pd.project_id = th.project_id

-- Step 6: Optional - Group by project to get the overall total project costs, revenue, and profits
ORDER BY total_profit DESC;

-- Step 7: Validate the data to ensure no invalid or missing values
