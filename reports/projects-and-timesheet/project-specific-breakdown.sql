Algorithm:
  
Project_Specific_Breakdown(projectId, startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve the specific project data using the project ID for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. Retrieve timesheet entries, project costs, and project revenue for the project.
  3. For the project, calculate the total cost, total revenue, and total hours worked.
  4. Optionally, calculate the total billable and non-billable hours for the project.
  5. Optionally, calculate any discrepancies between planned and actual project costs or hours worked.
  6. Validate the project data (ensure no invalid or missing values).
  7. Store the project-specific breakdown data and return the results (detailed view of the projectâ€™s cost, revenue, and hours worked).
