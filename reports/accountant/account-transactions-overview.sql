Algorithm:
  
Account_Transactions_Overview(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all account transactions (debits, credits, transfers) within the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. Group the transactions by account type or category (e.g., cash, receivables, payables).
  3. For each account type, calculate the total debits and credits:
     - Total Debits = Sum of all debit transactions for the account type.
     - Total Credits = Sum of all credit transactions for the account type.
  4. Optionally, calculate the net movement for each account type:
     - Net Movement = Total Credits - Total Debits.
  5. Calculate the overall total debits and credits across all account types.
  6. Validate the transaction data (ensure no invalid or missing entries).
  7. Store the account transactions data and return the results (overview of account movements by type).

SQL:
-- Step 1: Retrieve all account transactions within the specified date range
WITH account_transactions AS (
    SELECT
        t.transaction_id,
        t.transaction_date,
        t.transaction_type, -- 'debit' or 'credit'
        t.amount,
        a.account_id,
        a.account_name,
        a.account_type -- e.g., 'cash', 'receivables', 'payables'
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
    WHERE t.transaction_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
),

-- Step 2: Group transactions by account type or category (e.g., cash, receivables, payables)
account_summary AS (
    SELECT
        at.account_type,
        SUM(CASE WHEN at.transaction_type = 'debit' THEN at.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_debits,
        SUM(CASE WHEN at.transaction_type = 'credit' THEN at.amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_credits
    FROM account_transactions at
    GROUP BY at.account_type
)

-- Step 3: Calculate net movement for each account type and return overall totals
SELECT
    asummary.account_type,
    asummary.total_debits,
    asummary.total_credits,
    (asummary.total_credits - asummary.total_debits) AS net_movement
FROM account_summary asummary

-- Step 4: Calculate the overall total debits and credits across all account types
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Total' AS account_type,
    SUM(asummary.total_debits) AS total_debits,
    SUM(asummary.total_credits) AS total_credits,
    SUM(asummary.total_credits) - SUM(asummary.total_debits) AS net_movement
FROM account_summary asummary;

-- Step 5: Validate the transaction data (ensure no invalid or missing entries)
-- You can add a validation clause to ensure that there are no invalid or missing entries.
-- For example, if 'amount' is NULL or if there are transactions with missing 'account_id':
-- Add a check for missing or invalid amounts, transaction types, etc.
