Algorithm:
  
System_Activity_Logs(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all system activity logs within the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each log entry, extract the following details:
     - Log ID
     - Date and time of the event
     - User or system that initiated the activity
     - Type of activity (e.g., login, data access, system change)
     - Success or failure status of the activity
     - Any related error messages or warnings
  3. Group the logs by activity type or status (e.g., successful, failed, warning).
  4. Calculate the total number of activities by type (e.g., number of successful logins, failed access attempts).
  5. Optionally, identify any abnormal or suspicious activities (e.g., failed login attempts, error spikes).
  6. Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect log entries).
  7. Store the activity log data and return the results (summary of activities by type and status, with detailed log information).

SQL:

    log_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    date_time DATETIME NOT NULL,          -- Date and time of the activity
    user_or_system VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- User or system initiating the activity
    activity_type ENUM('login', 'data_access', 'system_change', 'error', 'warning', 'other') NOT NULL, -- Type of activity
    status ENUM('success', 'failure', 'warning') NOT NULL, -- Success, failure, or warning
    error_message TEXT NULL               -- Error message or warning if applicable

    GROUP BY user_or_system
    HAVING failed_logins > 3 -- Define the threshold for abnormal activity (e.g., more than 3 failed logins)
)

-- Final SELECT: Return the activity summary and details of abnormal activities
