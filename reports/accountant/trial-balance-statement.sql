Algorithm:
  
  Trial_Balance_Statement(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all ledger accounts and their balances for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each account, extract the balance (debit or credit).
  3. Sum the total debits and total credits across all accounts.
  4. Verify that the total debits and credits are equal (trial balance check):
     - Total Debits = Total Credits (This is required for the trial balance to be balanced).
  5. Group accounts by category (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses).
  6. Calculate the net balance for each account category:
     - Net Balance = Total Credits - Total Debits for each category.
  7. Validate the trial balance data (ensure no incorrect or missing entries).
  8. Store the trial balance statement and return the results (detailed listing of accounts, debits, credits, and balance check).
