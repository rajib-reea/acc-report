Algorithm:
  
General_Ledger_Summary(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all ledger entries for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each ledger entry, extract the account details (e.g., account number, account name, transaction amount).
  3. Group the entries by account type or category (e.g., assets, liabilities, equity).
  4. For each account type, calculate the total debit and credit amounts:
     - Total Debits = Sum of all debit entries for the account type.
     - Total Credits = Sum of all credit entries for the account type.
  5. Optionally, calculate the net balance for each account type:
     - Net Balance = Total Credits - Total Debits.
  6. Calculate the overall totals for debits and credits across all account types.
  7. Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect entries).
  8. Store the general ledger summary data and return the results (summary of accounts with their balances).

 SQL: 
-- Step 1: Retrieve all ledger entries within the specified date range
WITH ledger_entries AS (
    SELECT
        le.ledger_id,
        le.account_id,
        a.account_name,
        a.account_type,  -- e.g., 'assets', 'liabilities', 'equity'
        le.transaction_date,
        le.debit_amount,
        le.credit_amount
    FROM general_ledger le
    JOIN accounts a ON le.account_id = a.account_id
    WHERE le.transaction_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
),

-- Step 2: Group the entries by account type
account_classification AS (
    SELECT
        le.account_type,
        SUM(le.debit_amount) AS total_debits,
        SUM(le.credit_amount) AS total_credits
    FROM ledger_entries le
    GROUP BY le.account_type
)

-- Step 3: Optionally calculate the net balance for each account type
SELECT
    ac.account_type,
    ac.total_debits,
    ac.total_credits,
    (ac.total_credits - ac.total_debits) AS net_balance
FROM account_classification ac

-- Step 4: Calculate the overall totals for debits and credits across all account types
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Total' AS account_type,
    SUM(ac.total_debits) AS total_debits,
    SUM(ac.total_credits) AS total_credits,
    SUM(ac.total_credits) - SUM(ac.total_debits) AS net_balance
FROM account_classification ac;

-- Step 5: Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect entries)
-- Example: You can add additional validation for missing or negative values.
