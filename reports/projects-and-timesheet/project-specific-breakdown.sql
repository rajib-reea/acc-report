Algorithm:
  
Project_Specific_Breakdown(projectId, startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve the specific project data using the project ID for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. Retrieve timesheet entries, project costs, and project revenue for the project.
  3. For the project, calculate the total cost, total revenue, and total hours worked.
  4. Optionally, calculate the total billable and non-billable hours for the project.
  5. Optionally, calculate any discrepancies between planned and actual project costs or hours worked.
  6. Validate the project data (ensure no invalid or missing values).
  7. Store the project-specific breakdown data and return the results (detailed view of the projectâ€™s cost, revenue, and hours worked).

 SQL:
-- Step 1: Retrieve specific project data using the project ID within the specified date range
WITH project_data AS (
    SELECT
        p.project_id,
        p.project_name,
        p.start_date,
        p.end_date
    FROM projects p
    WHERE p.project_id = :projectId
      AND p.start_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
),

-- Step 2: Retrieve timesheet entries for the specified project
timesheet_data AS (
    SELECT
        te.project_id,
        SUM(te.hours_worked) AS total_hours_worked,
        SUM(CASE WHEN te.billable = 1 THEN te.hours_worked ELSE 0 END) AS total_billable_hours,
        SUM(CASE WHEN te.billable = 0 THEN te.hours_worked ELSE 0 END) AS total_non_billable_hours
    FROM timesheet_entries te
    WHERE te.project_id = :projectId
      AND te.entry_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
    GROUP BY te.project_id
),

-- Step 3: Retrieve project cost and revenue data
project_cost_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        pr.project_id,
        prc.total_cost,
        pr.client_rate
    FROM projects_revenue pr
    JOIN projects_costs prc ON pr.project_id = prc.project_id
    WHERE pr.project_id = :projectId
)

-- Step 4: Combine all the data to calculate total cost, total revenue, total hours worked, etc.
SELECT
    pd.project_id,
    pd.project_name,
    COALESCE(prc.total_cost, 0) AS total_cost,
    COALESCE(prc.client_rate, 0) * COALESCE(tsd.total_hours_worked, 0) AS total_revenue,
    COALESCE(tsd.total_hours_worked, 0) AS total_hours_worked,
    COALESCE(tsd.total_billable_hours, 0) AS total_billable_hours,
    COALESCE(tsd.total_non_billable_hours, 0) AS total_non_billable_hours,
    -- Step 5: Calculate discrepancies between planned and actual costs or hours worked (if applicable)
    (COALESCE(prc.client_rate, 0) * COALESCE(tsd.total_hours_worked, 0)) - COALESCE(prc.total_cost, 0) AS discrepancy_in_revenue,
    COALESCE(tsd.total_hours_worked, 0) - COALESCE(prc.total_cost / prc.client_rate, 0) AS discrepancy_in_hours_worked

FROM project_data pd
LEFT JOIN timesheet_data tsd ON pd.project_id = tsd.project_id
LEFT JOIN project_cost_revenue prc ON pd.project_id = prc.project_id;

-- Step 6: Validate the project data to ensure no invalid or missing values
