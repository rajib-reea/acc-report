Algorithm:
  EquityMovementSummary(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve opening equity balance.
  2. Retrieve changes in equity (Retained Earnings, New Investments, Dividends Paid).
  3. Calculate equity movements:
     Adjusted Equity = Opening Equity + Retained Earnings + New Investments - Dividends
  4. Validate the updated equity balance.
  5. Store the report and return the results.
