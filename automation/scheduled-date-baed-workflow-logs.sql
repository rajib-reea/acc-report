Algorithm:
  
Scheduled_Date_Based_Workflow_Logs(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all scheduled workflows that are triggered based on specific dates within the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each scheduled workflow, extract the following details:
     - Workflow ID
     - Scheduled date
     - Date and time the workflow was triggered
     - Status of the workflow (e.g., completed, failed, pending)
     - Any errors or warnings associated with the workflow
  3. Group the workflows by their scheduled date.
  4. Calculate the number of workflows triggered on each specific date within the range.
  5. Optionally, calculate the success rate of the workflows for each scheduled date:
     - Success Rate = (Number of Successful Workflows / Total Workflows) * 100.
  6. Identify any workflows that failed to execute or encountered issues on specific scheduled dates.
  7. Validate the data (ensure no missing or incorrect workflow entries).
  8. Store the scheduled workflow log data and return the results:
     - Summary of workflows by scheduled date, success rate, failure reasons, and any issues.
