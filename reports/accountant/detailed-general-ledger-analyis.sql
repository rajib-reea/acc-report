Algorithm:
  
Detailed_General_Ledger_Analysis(startDate, endDate):
  1. Retrieve all ledger entries for the specified date range (startDate to endDate).
  2. For each ledger entry, extract detailed transaction information (e.g., date, account number, description, debit/credit amount).
  3. Group the entries by account type or account number.
  4. Calculate the total debits and credits for each account, including:
     - Total Debits = Sum of all debit entries for the account.
     - Total Credits = Sum of all credit entries for the account.
  5. For each account, list individual transactions, including:
     - Transaction Date, Description, Amount (Debit or Credit).
  6. Calculate the net balance for each account:
     - Net Balance = Total Credits - Total Debits.
  7. Identify any discrepancies, such as unmatched or missing transactions.
  8. Validate the analysis data (ensure no missing, invalid, or incorrect entries).
  9. Store the detailed ledger analysis data and return the results (list of all transactions, account balances, and discrepancies).

  SQL:
  
-- Step 1: Retrieve all ledger entries within the specified date range
WITH ledger_entries AS (
    SELECT
        le.ledger_id,
        le.account_id,
        a.account_name,
        a.account_type,  -- e.g., 'assets', 'liabilities', 'equity'
        le.transaction_date,
        le.description,
        le.debit_amount,
        le.credit_amount
    FROM general_ledger le
    JOIN accounts a ON le.account_id = a.account_id
    WHERE le.transaction_date BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
),

-- Step 2: Group the entries by account type or account number
account_summary AS (
    SELECT
        le.account_id,
        le.account_type,
        SUM(le.debit_amount) AS total_debits,
        SUM(le.credit_amount) AS total_credits
    FROM ledger_entries le
    GROUP BY le.account_id, le.account_type
),

-- Step 3: List individual transactions by account
individual_transactions AS (
    SELECT
        le.account_id,
        le.transaction_date,
        le.description,
        CASE
            WHEN le.debit_amount > 0 THEN le.debit_amount
            ELSE le.credit_amount
        END AS transaction_amount,
        CASE
            WHEN le.debit_amount > 0 THEN 'Debit'
            ELSE 'Credit'
        END AS transaction_type
    FROM ledger_entries le
)

-- Step 4: Calculate the net balance for each account
SELECT
    asum.account_id,
    asum.account_type,
    asum.total_debits,
    asum.total_credits,
    (asum.total_credits - asum.total_debits) AS net_balance
FROM account_summary asum

-- Step 5: List individual transactions for each account
UNION ALL
SELECT
    it.account_id,
    'Transaction' AS account_type,  -- Individual transactions are listed separately
    NULL AS total_debits,  -- No total debits for individual transactions
    NULL AS total_credits,  -- No total credits for individual transactions
    it.transaction_amount,
    it.transaction_type
FROM individual_transactions it

-- Step 6: Optionally, identify discrepancies (e.g., missing transactions or unmatched entries)
-- Example: Using LEFT JOIN to detect discrepancies (for illustration purposes)
LEFT JOIN general_ledger gl ON gl.ledger_id = it.ledger_id
WHERE gl.transaction_date IS NULL  -- This could identify missing transactions

-- Step 7: Validate the analysis data (ensure no missing, invalid, or incorrect entries)
-- Example: Filtering out invalid entries like negative amounts
WHERE (it.transaction_amount >= 0 OR it.transaction_amount IS NULL)

-- Step 8: Store the analysis data (assuming this is done programmatically)
-- If needed, results can be stored in a separate table or returned for further processing.
